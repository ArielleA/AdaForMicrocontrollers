Here goes a sample of my startup files written in ADA will a little essential asm inserts.
They need a modifed linker scripts - also included (due to unexpected order of linked modules ?!).
Of course move/copy parts can be written in ADA too, but then there is no way to compile them to such a fast code,
and declaration of ISR procedure are not importand here as an example.

These startups sets vectors tables, initiate memory and jump to main procedure.
