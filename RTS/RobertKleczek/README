Short instruction - longer I'll write later

1. Copy contents of arm-eabi into installed & working AdaCore into lib/gnat/arm-eabi folder
2. Build runtime inside every ravenscar directories with gprbuild and runtime-build.gpr files
3. Copy arm folder with contents whenever you want
4. Copy examples whenever you want
5. Set proper directory paths in the arm/files.gpr
6. Open example demo_leds.gpr with gps editor
7. Set scenario variables (only for stm32f103vc, stm32f407vg, stm32f373rc are implemented)
8. Build project (using gprbuild set in gps preferences)

9. Think should compile & run (but execution was wan tested on real board, so forgive me any bugs)
10. Tomorrow I'll write some instruction to use this framework on our forum.

Robert Kleczek.
